/**
 * This block's init-params contract — the upstream dataset a new instance embeds,
 * and the (scope, model) combination it embeds it with.
 *
 * Those two are what a creator actually chooses; everything else in the model's
 * `BlockData` always defaults. `embeddingInitializedForAnchor` is the UI's
 * re-seed guard, `mem`/`cpu` are opt-in overrides the workflow otherwise sizes
 * itself, and `defaultBlockLabel` is written by the UI from the chosen input's
 * option label.
 *
 * The two fields travel as a pair. A scope's `columns` are anchored ids that
 * resolve against `inputAnchor`, so a template carrying an `embedding` without
 * the matching `inputAnchor` seeds a selection that points at nothing. The
 * contract cannot express that pairing as a type, so both stay optional and the
 * args projection — which already refuses an incomplete selection — is what
 * catches the mismatch at run time.
 *
 * Both fields are optional because the projection hands live state back
 * untouched, and a freshly created block holds `undefined` and `{}` there.
 * Requiring either would make the block export a file its own kind refuses to
 * apply, so export and apply would stop being inverses.
