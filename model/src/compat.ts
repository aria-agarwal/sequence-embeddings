/**
 * Embedding-model catalog and scope↔model compatibility (model side).

 * Single source of truth for three things:
 *  - which models exist and how they consume a scope (`EMBEDDING_MODELS`),
 *  - which models can embed a given scope (`compatibleModels`),
 *  - the specialist-first default model for a scope (`recommendedModel`).
 *
 * The per-card UI dropdowns (bidirectional filtering) and the args validator both
 * read from here, so the offered options and the validated pairs cannot drift.
 *
 * Rollout: pass 1 ships the models whose input is the AA sequence column already
 * gathered per scope (plus PeptideCLM-2, which converts AA→SMILES in the Python
 * step). SCEPTR is pass 2 — it needs paired V-gene + CDR1/2/3 assembly. A model is
 * only offered once it is **fully wired end-to-end** (weight asset packaged +
 * workflow routing); see `ENABLED_MODELS`.
